# 💬 Sentiment Analysis – Task 2 | Pinnacle Labs Internship

This repository contains **Task 2** of my **Data Science Internship** at **Pinnacle Labs**, where I built a **Sentiment Analysis** model using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

To analyze text data and determine the **sentiment** (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of customer feedback, helping businesses make better decisions based on user opinions.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Preprocessing (Cleaning, Lemmatization)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression Model
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Google Colab 💻
- Pandas & Numpy 📊
- NLTK for NLP tasks
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization

---

## 🔍 How it Works

1. Clean and preprocess raw text data
2. Vectorize the data using TF-IDF
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Predict and evaluate sentiment
5. Test model with new custom sentences
